Mistery2 - Impossible to resolve

Mistery1 - This sudoku is extremely hard. The function was modified to
include a counter, it would add 1 for every loop it underwent (minor
modification outlined below). The printed number of counts was: 3793687

Mistery3 - This sudoku is of "hard" difficulty. For the modified
function it returned a count of: 126954


Modification to keep track of loops:

bool solve_board(char board[9][9], int& count){

  (...)

  for (int digit = 1; digit <= 9; digit++){

    char char_digit = digit + '0';

    count +=1;

    if (valid_move(row, col, char_digit, board)){

  (...)
}
